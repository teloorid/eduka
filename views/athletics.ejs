                            beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that
                            they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to
                            those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through
                            shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a
                            free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able
                            to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in
                            certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will
                            frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted.
